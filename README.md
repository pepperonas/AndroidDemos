# AndroidDemos

This app contains various Android- and Java-modules.


## Structure

Since this project is an Android showcase the modules are supported by gradle. If a showcase contains a Java console or JavaFX application, you will find them inside the particular module (named `java_console_app` or `java_fx_app`).
